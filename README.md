# Vintage Relative Numbering
Relative numbering for Sublime's Vintage mode.

## Install Instructions

1. Navigate to Sublime's Package directory. This can be found by opening up Sublime's console (``Ctrl + ` ``, or `View > Show Console` ), and running `sublime.packages_path()`.

2. Place the `vintage_relnums` folder inside the Packages directory.

3. Ensure that [Vintage mode](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html) is enabled for Sublime.

Any time you enter `Command` or `Visual` mode relative numbers will be displayed.

## Helping Out

Please feel free to help out and imporve this plugin. It is my first sublime plugin and so is fairly simple, and should be easy to improve.

I used [OdatNurd's Plugin 101 tutorial videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGfKZJVuHW91zln4ADyZA3sxGEmq32Wse) to get started. If you're interested in learning how to develop Sublime plugins, it is a great starting point.
